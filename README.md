# VRC++ - improves experience in VRChat
This tool (will) make your VRChat life better with many features.
This only provides converting log to SQLite database; An implementation of frontend is [here](https://github.com/nowf41/VRCPP-front).

## why `++`?
`++` means add 1 to something in C. I want this tool to improve your experience in VRChat. The name contains "C++" by chance, but this tool **DOESN'T** let you to create something with VR experience with C++. Don't be confused!

## How to execute?
1. Download and setup nodejs and npm
2. run `npm run start`

## frontend is completely separated
My frontend implementation can be found at [here](https://github.com/nowf41/VRCPP-front).

Now this tool is developing. Please contribute this software!
