# VRC++ - improves experience in VRChat
This tool (will) make your VRChat life better with many features.

## why `++`?
`++` means add 1 to something in C. I want this tool to improve your experience in VRChat. The name contains "C++" by chance, but this tool **DOESN'T** let you to create something with VR experience with C++. Don't be confused!

## How to execute?
Just download Bun and run `bun parser/index.ts` and `bun web/index.ts`.

Now this tool is developing. Please contribute this software!
